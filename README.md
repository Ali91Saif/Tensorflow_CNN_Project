# Tensorflow_CNN_Project
## TensorFlow_Image_Classification_CNN
## This is an Image Classification Project in whichi have developed a  CNN Model using Tensorflow.
## Dataset is consists of Thousands of the images of Cats and Dogs.
## This Convolutional Neural Network consists of 64 neurons and a filter of 3 x 3 Matrix has been applied.
##  In this Model ,i have implimented Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU) function for the Activation and 
##  Sigmoid function has been implimented in output layer for final output extraction.
## Model Compilation:
##      for optimization,used RootMeanSquared Propagation(rmsprop)
##      Loss Function(Binary_Crossentropy) has been optimized
##      Accuracy Metrics has been used to jugde the performance of this model.
##  Model has been train on training dataset and validated with test dataset.
##  Accuracy and Loss plots have been plotted for visualization and Comparision.
